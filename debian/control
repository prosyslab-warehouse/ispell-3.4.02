Description: International Ispell (an interactive spelling corrector)
 Ispell corrects spelling in plain text, LaTeX, sgml/html/xml, and nroff files.
 [x]Emacs and jed have nice interfaces to ispell, and ispell works from many
 other tools and from the command line as well.
 .
 No ispell dictionaries are included in this package; you must install
 at least one of them ("iamerican" is recommended by default for no good
 reason); install the "ispell-dictionary" package(s) for the language(s)
 you and your users will want to spell-check.
 .
 It's a good idea to install "word list" package(s) for the same language(s),
 because they'll be used by ispell's (L)ookup command.
