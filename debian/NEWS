ispell (3.3.02-4) unstable; urgency=low

  This is the latest, and most probably the last, upstream version of ispell.
  Support for HTML or TeX files checking was slightly improved, limited support
  for UTF-8 in American and British dictionaries was added (`ispell -T utf8'),
  and plenty of old bugs were fixed.


  Small, large, huge and insane versions of American and British ispell
  dictionaries are now available.  They are contained in packages which
  names start with the `iamerican-' or `ibritish-' prefixes (for example
  iamerican-large, ibritish-small). The medium-sized versions of the
  dictionaries are included in `iamerican' and `ibritish' packages.


  Unfortunately, ispell seems to be no longer maintained by its upstream
  authors, so you should try switching to alternate spell-checkers like
  aspell or hunspell.
