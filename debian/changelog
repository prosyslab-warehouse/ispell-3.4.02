ispell (3.4.02-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make ienglish-common depend on ispell version not earlier than current
    ${source:Upstream-Version} (closes: #980207, #980208).
  * Provide autopkgtest checks for the package. The tests check ispell
    behaviour on randomly chosen words, and on words from old but still
    open bug reports:
    + the 'validator' word is now recognised by all flavours of iamerican
       and ibritish package except for the '-small' ones (closes: #402053).

ispell (3.4.01-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
  * Drop no longer needed 0039-Man-page-issues-fix.patch, refresh other
    patches.
  * Bump debhelper's compat version to 13.
  * Move english.aff file to /usr/lib/ispell, but temporarily provide a link
    from the old location,just in case other packages need it. This fixes
    all the `breakout-link' lintian warnings.
  * Set `Coding-System' in info-ispell files to `utf-8', as upstream switched
    to UTF-8 as the default character encoding. Remove obsolete `Psell-Ispell'
    and `Language' fields.
  * Call `ispell-autobuildhash' without using full path to it in ispell's
    postinst (lintian).
  * Remove postinst and postrm of dictionary packages; they only contained
    work-around for some dictionaries-common's bug fixed a long time ago.
  * Provide simple upstream/metadata file (lintian).
  * Standards-Version: 4.5.1.

      by installing compressed munchlist word lists and skipping builds
      of hashes;
    + two special Debian-specific values are added into the LANGUAGES
      variable,  EXTRADICT is overridden per each target which allows us
      to use word list appropriate to the target;
    + pass -T utf8 to munchlist to avoid the `illegal characters' warnings.

  * 0027-Include-Debian-Makefile.languages.inc.patch: new patch that

    {american,british,english}/Makefile.

  * Use ispell-autobuildhash for all the British and American dictionary
    packages to make them architecture independent.

  * Update various debhelper files for multi-dictionaries support:
    + add debian/packages.d directory and make the debhelper files
      automatically generated at build time.
    + debian/control:
      - switch architecture of  ibritish/iamerican packages to all;
      - add all wamerican-*/wbritish-* packages into Build-Depends-Indep;
      - (build-)depend on dictionaries-common (>= 1.10.4~);
      - make all our dictionary packages depend on ienglish-common, which
        in turn depends on appropriate versions of dictionaries-common and
        ispell.
    + debian/rules:
      - build the insane versions of dictionaries;
      - split builds for architecture-dependent and independent packages.

  * Write a simple man page for defmt-sh and defmt-c deformatters.
  * Re-add README.source documenting that debhelper files are generated.

    + add versioned `Breaks' for all packages providing ispell-dictionary that
      are not architecture `all';
    + remove dependencies on `debconf | debconf-2.0' as they should be
      automatically re-added by debhelper.

  * 0001-Configuration.patch: use higher, upstream-provided values for
    MAXAFFIXLEN and MAXSTRINGCHARS (closes: #176926).
  * Remove update-ispell-dictionary script and its man page. The script has been
    marked as obsolete for more than 10 years.
  * debian/copyright: updated for new upstream version.
  * debian/ispell.doc-base, debian/ispell.info: removed, neither HTML nor info
    documentation is no longer provided by upstream.
  * debian/watch: update the download URL.
  * Really remove the debian/README.source file.

    + refresh patches to update diff offsets;

ispell (3.1.20.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * ispell now Depends on an ispell-dictionary rather than just
    Recommending it; see this bug report for my reasoning:
    #197852: ispell-dictionaries don't purge cleanly
  * the iamerican and ibritish dictionary packages now Recommend
    rather than Suggest wamerican and wbritish wordlists,
    respectively, because most users need them (ispell's
    (L)ookup command requires a word list).
  * Revised the descriptions in light of the above changes.
  * thanks to Agustin Martin Domingo <agmartin@debian.org> for
    testing and enabling ispell-autobuildhash (part of
    dictionaries-common):
    -- Added debian/ispell.postinst to test ispell-autobuildhash
       existence and run it if present.
    Closes: #41741: consider update-ispell-hash
  * thanks also to Agustin Martin Domingo for chasing down a
    debhelper bug (or misdocumented feature) and filing a separate
    bug report about that, and for testing the workaround:
    -- dh_clean --package=package will clean all *.debhelper snippets
       even if they do not belong to the selected package. Hacking
       around this (Commenting all dh_clean --package= lines)
    Closes: #199859: debhelper snippets get uninstalled during build
  * as a temporary solution to the -x problem, I've corrected the
    man page -- I will revisit this bug report in relation to
    ispell 3.2, so I'm leaving it open:
    #189188: Effect of -x flag differs from what is documented
  * changes in scowl 5-2 (and hence the word lists merged into the
    ispell american and british dictionaries) have added many common
    variant spellings, including "judgement".
    Closes: #146341: add "judgement"; knows only about "judgment"
  * chopsticks (and variants) are in the ispell iamerican and ibritish
    dictionaries since version 3.1.20.0-2, and in the wbritish,
    wamerican, and wcanadian word lists since version 5-1.  If you
    still have this problem with those (or later) versions, please
    re-open the bug report and provide version details.  Thanks.

  * Standards version update to 3.5.10:
    - compile with -g regardless of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS 'debug'
    - add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS 'noopt'
  * We no longer build the wbritish package here; that's
    now done (much better) by the scowl source package.
  * The dictionaries depend  on dictionaries-common, no longer need to
    pre-depend.
  * Removed most of our patches from config.X and put them in local.h
    where they belong.
  * Correct a syntax error in parse.y and adjust Build-Depends; thanks
    to Daniel Schepler <schepler@math.berkeley.edu>
    Closes: #168412: ispell: Build-Depends still not right
  * The ibritish and iamerican dictionaries now include the words from
    the SCOWL-derived wbritish and wamerican packages.
    Closes: #69068: ibritish: Isn't 'energise' a word?
    Closes: #134128: iamerican: doesn't know how to spell "nefarious"
    Closes: #151234: ibritish is missing towards, forwards, etc
    Closes: #165142: iamerican: please add "animus", "conflate", "opine", "politicize"
    Note: "conflate" is only int the "large" ispell dictionaries and in the "large"
    wamerican/wbritish word lists -- I presume it's there for good reason (infrequently
    used?).  If you feel strongly it belongs in the regular dictionaries, please
    reopen this bug report and I'll consult with upstream and consider moving it.
    I also have meant for a while to package the large ispell dictionaries
    (I have already packaged the large English wordlists) -- I *will* get
    to that one of these years.
  * Provide a better example for use of the -d parameter
    Closes: #192400: ispell: Manpage not up to date
  * Accept NMUs from the dictionaries-common transition; thanks again, Agustin.
    Closes: #102607: hash files should be 128 character pers string
    Closes: #123641: ispell: ispell does not use debconf
    Closes: #164239: Please update your iamerican package to IDWP new policy
    Closes: #164248: Please update your ibritish package to IDWP new policy
  * Removed all the control file and rules file weridness created to get us
    through the dictionaries-common transition; life is so much simpler now.
  * Debhelper compat 4 allowed me to simplify some more weird stuff
    in rules, particularly regarding the man pages (thanks, Joey).

    something else to do the conversions for you.)
    Closes: #113503: Converts all high-bit characters to entities on save

    changelogs, to the bottom of this changlog.
    Closes: #77234: Missing changelog entries
  * Not a bug -- these words are already handled properly by ispell,

    the shell's builtin "echo -e", hoping to become posix-shell compliant.
    Closes: #98479: "the update-ispell-dictionnary sh script includes bash-
    specific constructs."
  * postinst will now remove any stray /usr/doc/ispell/.dhelp left
    by old versions of ispell, dhelp, doc-base, or whatever.

  * Added brief text to the ispell man page about using -h (html mode) for
    XML and SGML too.
    Closes: #94120: "The manpage should say something about xml and sgml."
  * unable to reproduce (was probably an early woody X problem)
    Closes: #81424: ispell: Does not handle backspace under X
  * updated standards to policy version 3.5.6 (added support
    for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS).
  * changed ispell priority from optional to standard, to agree with
    the Debian override file.
  * corrected the description and info index location of the ispell
    info file (thanks to a new lintian warning).
  * added a new binary package "wbritish" (british word list), built from
    the british ispell dictionary using strix.py, a user-contributed
    (GPL'd) tool by Drew Parsons <dfparsons@ucdavis.edu>; strix.py
    has been added to the ispell source "addons" directory.
    Closes: #54015 "wordlist only provided for American English, not British"

    idict-british-english) which depend on dictionaries-common, q.v.; there

ispell (3.1.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * applied the unofficial ispell patch from Gerry Tierney that adds an
    HTML mode (-h), which works for XML and SGML too; thanks to
    debian-users Peter Karlsson and Brian Moore for bringing that patch
    to my attention.
  * made some changes in support of dictionaries-common and new-style
    Debian dictionary packages (note that dictionaries-common and
    new-style dictionaries are still being developed and tested):
     - ispell now supports and properly manages either old-style
       (i<language>) or new-style (idict-<language>) Debian
       dictionary packages.
     - the ``update-ispell-dictionaries'' command properly invokes
       the new ``select-ispell-default'' command (part of the
       dictionaries-common package) iff dictionaries-common has
       been installed.
     - the ispell source package will only create new-style Debian
       dictionaries (idict-american-english and idict-british-english)
       if you export ``NewStyleDictionaries'' in the build environment.
       These dictionaries contain the same words as the corresponding
       old-style dictionaries.
     - regardless of the above, the old-style dictionaries (iamerican
       and ibritish) are still created and are unchanged from previous
       releases (except for the location of their documentation files).
  * removed some unnecessary files from debian ``changes'' (thanks to
    a suggestion from my sponsor, Tony Mancill).
  * added ispellconfig as a symlink to update-ispell-dictionary, for
    convenience and consistency (thanks again, Tony).
  * abandoned yada in favor of debhelper, and so:
     - moved all docs from /usr/doc to /usr/share/doc
     - added FHS compatibility doc symlinks.
     - added md5sums.
     - automatically handle emacsen, debconf, doc-base, and
       (soon-to-be) dictionaries-common stuff.
  * changed update-ispell-dictionary to just advise the user and stop,
    when it is run by non-root, so now we install it with standard
    executable permissions.
  * updated TODO.Debian; it's significantly shorter now.

    Reason: this is why ispell allows each user to use a personal
    ~/.ispell_defaut file.

    - ispell: get rid of lengthy symlinks.
    - ibritish,iamerican: made the copyright file be a real file instead

  * Orphaned the package with the permission of the last Debian
